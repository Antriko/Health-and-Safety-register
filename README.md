# NodeJS App
First app I created with NodeJS and MySQL


### About
This was one of the first NodeJS apps I have made when I was first learning about NodeJS and the express framework.

My workplace asked if I could create an app that would be a health and safety register. This is so that rather than using a paper register for everyone to sign when they leave and enter the building they would be able to click a button on a host machine near the entrance of the building.

I was given some basic mockup designs to get some inspiration for the design, which were; https://imgur.com/a/leNgSQY

There are obviously tweaks that can be made now to make the code more efficient, such as implementing a better way to create an empty database if no database if present and other knacks here and there but this was just to get to the grip of what NodeJS and ExpressJS were.

Running the app would require a local instance of MySQL (through XAMPP) being ran in the background and then create a database called 'users', which can be changed in the connect.js file
